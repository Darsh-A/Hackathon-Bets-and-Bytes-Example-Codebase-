# Bets and Bytes (Insomnia'24 Hackathon) : Example

The Programming club of IISERM : Turing presents a very unique Hackathon: Bets and Bytes!
Bet & Byte is an innovative, computerized poker tournament where teams are challenged to program fully autonomous pokerbots to compete in a unique poker variant. Teams apply concepts from computer science, machine learning, mathematics, and game theory to outsmart their opponents and emerge victorious. The tournament offers a dynamic platform for competitors to showcase their programming skills while navigating the strategic complexities of the card game poker.

Entry Fee: 350 for upto Team of 3
Prize Pool: 10000Rs

Ruleset:
- Players/Teams are allowed any coding languages
- Event will be upto 7 hours wherein first 3 hours are given for the bots to adjust to the gameset (described below)
- Players/Teams can have their bot pre-built by the event date
- Use of AI is allowed only if the Players understands their code (this will be counted in evaluation)
- The decision making for the players turn should fully be handled by the bot ***IMP
- Players should not intervene from the point of input till the output of the turn that the player/bot has to make for that game ***IMP- Players/Team are allowed to tweak their code after a game is finished
 
Gameset
- The next 3 hours of the event are allocated for the players/team to go in a head to head bot vs bot competition
- Depending on number of participants, each player/team will play in a league like fashion with rounds having upto 4 players/teams
- The exact gameset will be announced 3 days prior to the event and shall be shared with the participants via email or text

Guidelines:
- Players are expected to build a fully autonomous poker bot that takes in the current game values (via inputs) and decides on best possible move it can make
- Players are encouraged to use game theory, machine learning and other relevant algorithms
- The above is not necessary as it only accounts for a fraction of the judging process
- Below are some resources that may help you start with the project

Evaluation:
- 50% will be allocated for the plan of action, complexity and the algorithms used
- 15% will be allocated for the working of the bot
- +5% for each game the bot wins
(Note: Players are encouraged to submit their projects even if their bots aren't fully functional)
